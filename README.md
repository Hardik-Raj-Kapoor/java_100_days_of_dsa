# 100 Days of DSA in Java
### Welcome to my 100 Days of DSA in Java journey!
This repository is a complete collection of Java implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms, built over the course of 100 days.

The goal of this journey was to strengthen problem-solving skills, master core DSA concepts, and implement everything from scratch in Java — while also practicing on LeetCode for reinforcement.

## About This Repository
+  Contains only Java code implementations (no theory/pseudocode, just clean code).
+  Each file/folder corresponds to a topic or problem covered during the challenge.
+  Covers theory topics → implementation → LeetCode practice workflow.
+  Goal: Build a solid foundation in DSA for interviews, competitive programming, and real-world problem-solving.
